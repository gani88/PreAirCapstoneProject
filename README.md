PreAir : Deep Learning Based on Prediction System and Image Classification for Detecting Air Quality Index.

<h2>Executive Summary/Abstract</h2>

The decrease air quality in the biosphere layer is a serious impact due to the effects of globalization and urbanization. Air pollution levels in many cities exceed legal threshold which can increase humans affected from respiratory disorders such as asthma, lung disease and increased mortality. In some big cities in Indonesia, people not realize of the pollution level they face in their daily life and it can be ‘silent killer’ to people. This is necessary to reduce the risk of poor air quality conditions. The quality of air can be measured by using a parameter named Air Quality Index(AQI). The key pollutants to calculate AQI are particulate matter Ozone (O3), Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), Sulphur Dioxide (SO2) and Carbon Monoxide (CO). Our projects deliberates the implementation of prediction and analyzing system for air quality monitoring using smartphone camera device and combine it with environmental condition like temperature and humidity. The obtained information and data can be updated in cloud platform. With the collected time series samples, the prediction analysis was done with neural network Multi-Layer. This can helps user monitor AQI-Level in their environment through a smartphone that always updates air condition based on database in cloud every few hours. 

<h2>Background of The Project</h2>

Our team chose this project because we saw the increasingly apprehensive natural conditions, especially the air pollution in most of the big cities in Indonesia that's experiencing rapid urbanization. Poor Air Quality Index (AQI) can cause health problems such as respiratory diseases, the risk of developing cancer and other serious ailments. It also contributes tremendous economic loss, especially since financial resources are required for giving medical assistance to the affected people. By utilizing Machine Learning technology, our team utilizes images taken by users from smartphones for testing and training. So that users get the AQI  Level output on their smartphone.

So, what is our goal? why we want to build this app or start this project? Here our goal :

1. Keep an Eye on Air Quality: Our app is designed to regularly check and keep track of the quality of the air around you. It gives you information about how clean or polluted the air is in your area.

2. Protect Your Breathing: By monitoring air pollution levels, our app helps you avoid potential respiratory issues. If the air quality starts to get worse, you'll get alerted so that you can take precautions and stay safe.

3. Supporting a Healthy Life: We want to help you live a healthier life. Our app provides you with the information you need to make better choices about outdoor activities and daily routines based on the air quality. This way, you can make decisions that positively impact your well-being.

In essence, our app aims to help you stay informed about the air you're breathing, protect your health, and make smart choices for a healthier lifestyle.
